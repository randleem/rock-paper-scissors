# Rock-Paper-Scissors

*2nd October 2020*
*Week 2 of [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk)*

This was our secind week Friday hackathon at the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk) where we were first introduced to fetch requests and promises. 

Jon (my paired-programming partner for the week) and I decided to use this [dad joke API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) to create our app.



Happy Gaming ü™® üßª ‚úÇÔ∏è
